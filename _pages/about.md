Graduated in IT in the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/), Spain (2010 - 2016), I have since then worked for some of the most important companies in Spain ([Santander Bank](https://www.santander.com/en/), [Telefonica](https://www.telefonica.com/en/), etc...) and some Consulting companies as a Cyber Security Consultant as well as a SysAdmin. 

I haven't been much of a developer since I started working but I'm trying to change that so that I can rotate to a DevOps role where I can use my professional knowledge of Unix SysAdmin with my newly aquired knowledge of developing.

I will try to upload some projects to my newly created [GitHub](https://github.com/draz1c) account, the first one of them being this personal site and blog which I will try to update from time to time whenever there is something relevant to write about.

Some of the topics I'm interested in are:

- > FPGA projects such as the [Mister FPGA](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) project to preserve old arcade systems and retro consoles.

- > Log aggregation and field extraction from many different logs sources and log formats by developping complex parsers using Regular expressions (**regex**) with technologies such as [ArcSight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcSight) and [Splunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splunk).

- > Linux & Unix administration, Hypervisor Virtualization (VMware ESXi, Xen, KVM), Docker, SIEM, etc...
